# College Project - Semi-Automated Welding Machine & Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This semi-automated welding machine is affordable compared to fully automated welding machines so it is economical for Small Scale Industries and can reduce human error.Quantity monitoring is an important task for controlling and correcting factors that are necessary for a proper weld. The major factors which affect the welding process are temperature, current and voltage, velocity, wind speed, and gas flow rate.
