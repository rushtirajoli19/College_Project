# Semi-Automated Welding Machine & Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
- Semi-automated welding machines are less expensive than fully automated welding equipment, making them suitable for small-scale industries and reducing human error. Quantity monitoring is a key duty for managing and correcting weld-related issues. Temperature, current and voltage, velocity, wind speed, and gas flow rate are the main parameters that influence the welding process.
- Here, We built machine that is semi-automated which is controlled using Arduino, Microcontroller and derived data from the system and built Multi-Linear Regression Model. Later, Which could be used in Edge Devices for Real time monitoring of Weld Quality.
